It creates a template app with a splash screen, a menu with four buttons (Play, Settings, Help, About), and one scene for each of the four buttons. It uses Corona SDK's built-in Storyboard to manage scenes.\r\n\r\nThe generated app also includes [RadLib](http://radamanthus.github.com/radlib/), a library of utility Lua functions to support Corona SDK development.\r\n\r\nIf you're not familiar with Ruby, or you just want the template code without this wrapper gem, please check out [Corona Game Template](http://radamanthus.github.com/corona-game-template/).\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n    gem install nakor\r\n\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n    nakor generate awesome_app\r\n\r\nThis will create the awesome_app directory in the current directory.
