Corona Game Template version 1.0
(c) 2011 by Radamanthus Batnag

This is a template project for building games using Ansca Mobile's Corona SDK (http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/).

This has been tested against Daily Build Version 2011.696 (2011.8.2). It uses the Storyboard API, therefore it will not work with builds that do not have yet the Storyboard API.

USAGE
Out of the box, this is a working Corona project. It includes a splash screen (loadmenu.lua, displays images/splashScreen.png for 1 second) and the following menu buttons:
- Play
- Settings
- Help
- About

Note the naming convention for button images: play.png is the button for Play, settings.png for Settings, etc.

The project directory structure follows my personal convention for projects:

appname
  +-- assets
  +-- appname
  +-- doc

- All code is in appname/appname.
- Game assets (e.g. Illustrator .ai files) are in appname/assets, finished PNGs are copied over to appname/appname because that's where Corona SDK expects them to be.
- The game design document (yes you should have one) and all other documentation are in appname/doc
